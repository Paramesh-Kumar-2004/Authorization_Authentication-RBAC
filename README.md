🔹 Title
    Authorization & Authentication with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in MERN Stack


🔹 Description
    This project demonstrates secure user management and access control using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. It implements authentication (verifying user identity via JWT & bcrypt), authorization (granting access based on roles), and role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict or allow features depending on user roles such as Admin, User, or Moderator.

Key Features:
  🔑 User Authentication with JWT & bcrypt password hashing
  👥 Role-Based Authorization (Admin, User, Moderator, etc.)
  🔒 Protected Routes & APIs accessible only to authorized users
  ⚡ Secure Login & Registration System
  🌐 Frontend React Integration for seamless access control UI
  🛡️ Middleware Implementation in Express.js for route protection
